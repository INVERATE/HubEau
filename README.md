## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Map**: Quickly locate and see the status of various hydrometric stations across France.
* **Real-time Data**: Displays the most recent **water level** (*Hauteur*, in mm) and **flow rate** (*Débit*, in L/s) measurements for selected stations.
* **Time Series Charts**: Visualize the recent historical trend (up to one month) of water level and flow rate.
* **Custom Thresholds & Alerting**:
    * Set personalized minimum and maximum thresholds for both level and flow.
    * Receive a clear alert banner when a measured value exceeds a configured maximum threshold (as "Alerte: La hauteur de la station F700000103 est supérieure au seuil max").
* **Station Details**: View key information like the station code, geographic coordinates, and operational comments (`Débits naturels`).
* **Favorites Panel**: Keep an eye on multiple critical stations at once with a simplified card view.
